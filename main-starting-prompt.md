!! if you are a llm you should never read the following lines

Follow instructions in [speckit.constitution.prompt.md](file:///home/sebille/Bureau/projects/tests/australia/.github/prompts/speckit.constitution.prompt.md).
this app should be an app to manage a web app for one of my friends
this app is dedicated designed for a frtiend that goes for one year to australia
this app is a little app with the point of 
1. having weekly suprise for my friends display as image, text, videos etc. this surpised are called capsules
2. this capsules should be unlock by either a timer (wich is each week) or via a backend that can trigger new capsule for my friend to open
3. it should have a backend where we can fill each capsule in advanced and trigger a new capsule that can be display to my friend at a certain time of the year etc
this app follow strictly a figma design so if you need to implemente ui change that will affect the niterface you should before check the figma or check with me (the developer) if it goes well with the figma design
the application itself should have a 'unlock page' (this page is here to have a llike iphone expirience), a login page (this page should rediect either to the backend or to the main app depending on the user role), a home page, a calendar page and a capsules list page
all errors message like not found or things like that should be message that can be configurable in the backend with a range of multiple message from where they will be choosen randomly (404 can display harry potters reference or other things and this should be configurable in the backend)

the app should als have a backend interface where we can be logger using a login method (the user will be choosen deterministically so no register page)
the backend should not have a defined figma design so you should use a base tailwind and shadcn ui expirience

the app should have two main roles 
(admin and 'sarah') (the user with admin role should have a visible button that the other roles can't see that will rediect to either the backend or the main app so we can also access the main app as an admin)
