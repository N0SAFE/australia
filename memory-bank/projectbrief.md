# Project Brief

## Overview
A Docker-first SaaS template using Next.js (App Router) and NestJS in a Turborepo monorepo.
It uses ORPC for end-to-end type safety and declarative routing.

## Core Goals
- Provide a robust, type-safe foundation for SaaS applications.
- Enable efficient local development with Docker.
- Support production deployment (e.g., Render).

## Current Focus
- Fixing UI issues in the Tiptap editor (specifically the "Add Media" button).
- Implementing video processing features (Phase 4).
